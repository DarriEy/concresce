## A Community Platform for Converging Hydrological Modeling Assets

This framework represents a transformative approach to community hydrological modeling, where diverse modeling assets, tools, and workflows converge into a unified research-to-operations platform. Drawing from the concept of "concrescence" – the process of growing together or coalescing – this initiative embodies the vision of bringing together the hydrological community's collective capabilities into an accessible, intuitive, and powerful modeling ecosystem.
At its core, this platform facilitates the seamless confluence of:

- Research innovations transitioning smoothly into operational forecasting
- Community-developed models integrating through standardized interfaces
- Distributed expertise converging through collaborative workflows
- Heterogeneous data streams merging into coherent modeling pipelines
- Multi-scale processes connecting from local to continental domains

Built on the principle that the convergence of community assets creates capabilities greater than the sum of individual parts, this framework provides researchers, operational forecasters, and water resource managers with an intuitive platform that spans the entire hydrological modeling workflow – from data ingestion and model configuration through calibration, execution, and decision support delivery.
Through its modular architecture and emphasis on reproducibility, the platform accelerates the translation of cutting-edge hydrological science into actionable water intelligence, enabling rapid prototyping of operational improvements while maintaining the scientific rigor necessary for advancing our understanding of complex water systems. The framework's open-source foundation ensures that innovations from across the hydrological community can flow together, creating a dynamic confluence where scientific discovery meets operational excellence.
